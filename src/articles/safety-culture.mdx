# Building a Safety Culture: Beyond Policies and Procedures

You can have the best safety policies in the world, comprehensive procedures for every task, and state-of-the-art equipment—yet still have a dangerous workplace. Why? Because safety culture transcends documentation and systems.

A genuine safety culture exists when workers believe that safety matters, when they feel empowered to speak up, and when safe behavior is the norm even when no one is watching. This cannot be mandated by policy or achieved through fear. It must be built deliberately, authentically, and patiently.

## What is Safety Culture?

Safety culture is the shared values, beliefs, and behaviors regarding safety that exist within an organization. It is "how we do things around here" when it comes to health and safety.

Strong safety cultures have certain characteristics:

- Safety is a core value, not just a priority (priorities change; values endure)
- Workers feel psychologically safe raising concerns
- Leaders demonstrate commitment through actions, not just words
- Learning from incidents is valued over blame
- Everyone feels responsible for safety, not just safety officers
- Safety considerations are integrated into all decisions
- Continuous improvement is expected and supported

## Why Culture Matters More Than Compliance

Compliance focuses on meeting minimum legal requirements. Culture focuses on genuinely protecting people.

Consider two scenarios:

**Compliance-Driven Organization:**
Workers wear PPE because they will be disciplined if caught without it. They report incidents because they are required to. They follow procedures when supervisors are watching. Safety is something imposed upon them.

**Culture-Driven Organization:**
Workers wear PPE because they understand the risks and value their own wellbeing. They report near misses because they want to prevent incidents for their colleagues. They follow procedures because they believe these procedures keep them safe. Safety is something they embrace.

Which organization would you rather work in? Which is genuinely safer?

## The Foundations of Safety Culture

Building a strong safety culture requires attention to several foundational elements:

### 1. Leadership Commitment and Visibility

Leaders set the tone. If leadership treats safety as important only in meetings but ignores it in daily decisions, workers will notice.

**What genuine leadership commitment looks like:**
- Leaders participate in safety inspections and observations
- Safety is a standing agenda item in leadership meetings
- Budget allocations reflect safety priorities
- Leaders intervene when they observe unsafe behavior, regardless of pressure
- Safety considerations influence business decisions
- Leaders attend and engage in safety training
- Personal protective equipment compliance includes leaders

**What undermines leadership commitment:**
- "Do as I say, not as I do" behavior
- Safety budget requests consistently rejected
- Production always prioritized over safety
- Leaders exempt themselves from safety requirements
- Safety only discussed after incidents
- No consequences for repeated safety violations
- No recognition for safety excellence

### 2. Worker Participation and Empowerment

Safety cannot be imposed from above. Those doing the work understand the risks best and must be genuinely involved.

**Effective worker participation includes:**
- Consultation on safety decisions that affect them
- Involvement in risk assessments and procedure development
- Authority to stop work when unsafe
- Mechanisms to raise concerns without fear
- Safety representatives with real influence
- Worker-led safety observations
- Input into equipment and process design

**Barriers to participation:**
- Token consultation without genuine consideration
- Fear of reprisal for raising concerns
- "The safety department's job" mentality
- Workers excluded from decisions affecting them
- Concerns raised but never addressed
- Complex reporting systems that discourage engagement
- Blame culture when things go wrong

### 3. Communication and Information Flow

Information must flow freely in all directions—up, down, and across the organization.

**Effective communication includes:**
- Regular safety briefings and toolbox talks
- Incident learnings shared organization-wide
- Clear, understandable procedures and instructions
- Multiple channels for raising concerns
- Timely feedback on reported issues
- Celebration of safety successes
- Transparent incident investigations

**Communication failures include:**
- Information hoarded by management
- Workers learn about incidents through rumors
- Technical jargon that workers do not understand
- One-way "announcements" without dialogue
- Reported issues disappearing into a "black hole"
- Incident investigations kept secret
- Only negative communication about safety

### 4. Learning Environment vs. Blame Culture

How an organization responds to incidents and errors profoundly shapes culture.

**Learning environment characteristics:**
- Focus on understanding why incidents occurred
- Investigation seeks system improvements, not scapegoats
- Near misses celebrated as learning opportunities
- Mistakes used to improve systems
- Psychological safety to admit errors
- Recognition for reporting issues
- "What can we learn?" rather than "Who can we blame?"

**Blame culture characteristics:**
- Investigations focus on finding someone at fault
- Punishment emphasized over prevention
- Workers hide incidents and near misses
- Fear of reprisal for honest mistakes
- Same incidents recur because root causes are not addressed
- Individual accountability without examining contributing factors
- "Someone must pay" mentality

### 5. Competency and Training

People cannot work safely if they do not know how. Investment in genuine competency development demonstrates commitment to safety.

**Effective training approaches:**
- Job-specific training, not generic programs
- Practical demonstrations and practice
- Verification of understanding, not just attendance
- Refresher training as risks change
- Mentoring and coaching for new workers
- Time allocated for proper training
- Training in workers' languages

**Ineffective training approaches:**
- Generic online modules unrelated to actual work
- "Watch this video and sign here"
- No verification of competency
- Training treated as a box to tick
- Training conducted in workers' second language without support
- Inadequate time for proper skill development
- No follow-up or refresher training

## The Journey of Cultural Transformation

Transforming safety culture is not a quick fix. It is a journey that typically progresses through stages:

### Stage 1: Pathological ("Who cares as long as we don't get caught?")
Safety is ignored until an incident occurs. Messengers are shot. The focus is on not getting caught by regulators.

### Stage 2: Reactive ("Safety is important after incidents")
Organizations respond to incidents but do not proactively manage safety. Safety is driven by fear of consequences rather than genuine care.

### Stage 3: Calculative ("We have systems for everything")
Management systems are implemented, and safety is managed through procedures. Compliance is emphasized, but safety may still feel bureaucratic.

### Stage 4: Proactive ("We anticipate problems")
Organizations anticipate safety issues and address them before incidents occur. Leadership is engaged, and workers participate actively.

### Stage 5: Generative ("Safety is how we do business")
Safety is integrated into everything. Everyone feels responsible. Continuous improvement is the norm. Safety and productivity are seen as complementary, not competing.

Most organizations are somewhere on this journey. The goal is continuous progress toward a generative culture.

## Practical Strategies for Cultural Change

How do you actually build or strengthen your safety culture? Here are practical strategies:

### Start with Why

Help people understand why safety matters beyond compliance. Connect safety to personal values:
- Going home to family each day
- Long-term health and wellbeing
- Supporting colleagues
- Pride in work

When people understand the "why," they are more likely to embrace the "how."

### Make it Personal

Abstract statistics about safety do not motivate like personal stories. Share stories (with permission) of:
- Incidents that affected real people
- Near misses that could have been tragic
- How safety measures prevented potential incidents
- Workers who spoke up and prevented incidents

Personal stories create emotional connection that statistics cannot.

### Celebrate the Positive

Too often, safety communication focuses only on what went wrong. Celebrate what goes right:
- Recognize workers who demonstrate safety leadership
- Share success stories of hazard identification
- Celebrate milestone days without lost time incidents
- Acknowledge improvement trends
- Highlight innovative safety solutions from workers

What gets recognized gets repeated.

### Visible Leadership

Leaders must be seen engaging with safety:
- Conduct safety walkarounds and talk with workers
- Attend safety meetings and training
- Follow safety rules themselves
- Ask about safety in conversations
- Intervene when observing unsafe conditions
- Thank workers for raising concerns

Actions speak louder than words.

### Empower Workers

Give workers genuine authority and responsibility:
- Stop work authority when unsafe
- Involvement in safety decisions
- Resources to address identified hazards
- Time allocated for safety activities
- Recognition for safety contributions
- Clear processes for raising concerns

Empowered workers become safety advocates.

### Learn from Excellence

Study what goes right, not just what goes wrong:
- Observe workers performing tasks safely and understand why
- Identify teams with excellent safety records and learn from them
- Understand what enables safe performance
- Replicate success factors elsewhere

Learning from success is as valuable as learning from failure.

### Integrate, Don't Separate

Safety should not be a separate "safety program" but integrated into everything:
- Include safety in job descriptions and performance reviews
- Consider safety in procurement decisions
- Factor safety into project planning and timelines
- Include safety in design processes
- Integrate safety into operational procedures

When safety is integrated, it becomes normal rather than special.

## Measuring Safety Culture

Culture is difficult to measure, but indicators include:

### Leading Indicators (Proactive)
- Near miss and hazard reporting rates (higher is often better—indicates trust)
- Safety suggestion participation
- Safety training completion and engagement
- Safety walkthrough findings and closure rates
- Worker perception surveys
- Observation of safe behaviors
- Safety meeting participation and quality

### Lagging Indicators (Reactive)
- Lost time injury frequency rate
- Total recordable injury frequency rate
- Severity of incidents
- Workers' compensation claims
- Incident investigation quality
- Repeat incidents (indicates learning failures)

Crucially, high near miss reporting with low actual incidents suggests a strong culture where people feel safe reporting concerns before they become incidents.

## Common Pitfalls

Organizations often stumble when trying to build safety culture:

### The Poster Campaign Trap
Hanging motivational posters about safety does not change culture. Workers see through superficial efforts. Real change requires substantive action.

### The Blame Reflex
After an incident, the reflex to find and punish someone is strong. Resist it. Focus on understanding and improvement.

### The Compliance Ceiling
Achieving compliance is necessary but not sufficient. Don't stop at compliance when cultural transformation is the goal.

### The Top-Down Imposition
Culture cannot be imposed. It must be built collaboratively with genuine worker involvement.

### The Short-Term Thinking
Cultural change takes time. Leaders expecting overnight transformation will be disappointed and may give up prematurely.

### The "Safety vs. Production" False Choice
Safety and productivity are not opposing forces. Safe workplaces are typically more productive workplaces.

## The ESS Approach

At Eternal Safety Solutions, we emphasize culture alongside systems because we have seen that systems without culture produce compliance at best and meaningless paperwork at worst.

Our people-focused approach includes:

- Genuine consultation with workers at all levels
- Training that engages rather than lectures
- Systems designed for usability, not just compliance
- Leadership coaching on visible safety leadership
- Support for learning environments over blame
- Practical strategies tailored to your culture

We recognize that every organization's culture is unique, shaped by history, industry, leadership, and workforce. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.

## Your Culture Journey

Where is your organization on the safety culture journey? Consider these reflection questions:

- Do workers feel comfortable raising safety concerns?
- Is safety genuinely considered in business decisions, or just given lip service?
- How do leaders respond when safety and productivity appear to conflict?
- Are workers involved in safety decisions affecting them?
- What happens when someone reports a near miss?
- Do workers follow procedures because they are watched or because they believe in them?
- Is safety something done to workers or with workers?

Honest answers to these questions reveal your current culture and highlight opportunities for improvement.

## Taking the First Step

Building a strong safety culture is a journey, not a destination. Start where you are:

1. Assess your current culture honestly
2. Identify one concrete step you can take
3. Engage workers in the process
4. Demonstrate leadership commitment through action
5. Celebrate progress
6. Be patient and persistent

Remember: culture change happens through consistent small actions over time, not through grand gestures or one-off initiatives.
