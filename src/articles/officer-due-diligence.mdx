# Officer Due Diligence: Your Personal Liability Exposed

If you are a director, partner, or senior executive of a business in Australia, you have specific personal legal obligations for workplace health and safety that you cannot delegate away. Many officers do not fully understand these due diligence requirements until it is too late.

This article explains what officer due diligence means, why it matters, and how to ensure you are meeting your legal obligations.

## Who is an "Officer"?

Under Australian WHS legislation, an "officer" includes:

- Directors of companies
- Partners in partnerships
- Persons who make or participate in decisions affecting the whole or substantial part of the business
- Persons who have capacity to significantly affect the financial standing of the business

If you are in a position of significant influence or decision-making power, you are likely an officer with specific duties.

## The Due Diligence Obligation

Section 27 of the Work Health and Safety Act (in most jurisdictions) imposes a duty on officers to exercise due diligence to ensure the business complies with its WHS obligations.

This is not a vague suggestion. It is a specific legal duty with serious consequences for failure.

Importantly, this duty cannot be delegated. While you can engage safety consultants, employ safety managers, and implement systems, ultimate accountability remains with officers personally.

## What Does Due Diligence Actually Mean?

The legislation specifies what due diligence entails. It is not left to interpretation. Officers must take reasonable steps to:

### 1. Acquire and Keep Up-to-Date Knowledge of WHS Matters

You do not need to become a safety expert, but you must have sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions about WHS matters.

**In practice, this means:**
- Understanding basic WHS concepts and terminology
- Knowing your industry's common hazards and risks
- Staying informed about WHS legislative changes
- Attending relevant training or professional development
- Reading safety reports and understanding their implications

**Red flags of failure:**
- "I don't really understand safety matters"
- Never reading safety reports
- Relying entirely on others without basic personal knowledge
- No training or development in WHS matters

### 2. Gain an Understanding of Operations and Hazards

You must understand what your business actually does and what hazards this creates.

**In practice, this means:**
- Visiting workplaces and observing operations
- Understanding your business's high-risk activities
- Knowing your major hazards
- Understanding how your supply chain affects WHS
- Being familiar with your work locations and conditions

**Red flags of failure:**
- Never visiting operational sites
- No idea what hazards workers face
- Believing office-based officers need not understand operations
- Assumptions about operations without verification

### 3. Ensure Appropriate Resources and Processes

You must ensure the business has adequate resources to manage WHS and that proper processes exist.

**In practice, this means:**
- Allocating sufficient budget for WHS activities
- Ensuring adequate staffing with appropriate competencies
- Providing necessary equipment and facilities
- Supporting the implementation of systems and processes
- Not cutting safety resources during budget pressures

**Red flags of failure:**
- Consistently rejecting safety budget requests
- Inadequate staffing for the complexity of risks
- Expecting safety outcomes without resourcing them
- Treating safety as a cost to minimize rather than investment

### 4. Ensure Appropriate Information and Reporting Systems

You need systems that provide timely, accurate information about WHS performance.

**In practice, this means:**
- Regular safety reporting to the board or senior leadership
- Incident notification and investigation systems
- Hazard identification and reporting mechanisms
- Monitoring and measurement of safety performance
- Access to information needed for informed decisions

**Red flags of failure:**
- No regular safety reporting to officers
- Learning about serious incidents days or weeks after they occur
- No data on leading indicators (near misses, hazards reported)
- Only hearing about safety when something goes seriously wrong

### 5. Ensure Compliance Processes are Implemented

You must ensure the business actually implements systems and processes designed to meet WHS obligations.

**In practice, this means:**
- Verifying that policies and procedures are implemented, not just written
- Ensuring workers are trained and competent
- Confirming that equipment and systems are maintained
- Following up on audit findings and corrective actions
- Monitoring for compliance, not assuming it

**Red flags of failure:**
- Assuming systems are working without verification
- No follow-up on audit findings or recommendations
- Workers unaware of procedures that officers believe exist
- Policies written but not implemented

### 6. Verify the Provision and Use of Information, Training, and Supervision

You must ensure workers receive necessary information, training, instruction, and supervision.

**In practice, this means:**
- Verifying induction and training completion
- Ensuring supervisors are competent
- Confirming workers understand procedures
- Providing information in languages workers understand
- Ensuring adequate supervision ratios

**Red flags of failure:**
- Training completion not monitored
- Supervisors promoted without competency verification
- Incidents revealing workers did not know procedures
- Relying on contractors to self-manage without verification

## The Consequences of Failure

The consequences for failing to meet due diligence obligations are serious and personal:

### Criminal Liability

Officers can face personal criminal prosecution for failing to meet their due diligence obligations. This is separate from any prosecution of the business itself.

**Potential penalties:**
- Category 1 offenses: Up to 5 years imprisonment and/or fines exceeding $600,000
- Category 2 offenses: Substantial financial penalties
- Category 3 offenses: Financial penalties

These are not theoretical. Prosecutions of officers occur regularly in Australia.

### Civil Liability

Beyond criminal prosecution, officers may face:
- Personal liability for damages
- Disqualification from serving as a director
- Professional reputation damage
- Personal stress and impact on family

### No Insurance Shield

Many officers mistakenly believe that company insurance or directors and officers insurance will protect them. This is not always the case:

- Criminal fines cannot be insured
- Insurance may not cover willful or reckless conduct
- Insurance may not cover prosecution costs until verdict
- Deductibles can still be substantial

## Common Misconceptions

### "We Have a Safety Manager—That's Their Job"

While safety managers are valuable, they do not relieve officers of due diligence obligations. You remain personally responsible for ensuring the business meets its WHS obligations.

### "I'm Not Involved in Day-to-Day Operations"

Due diligence obligations apply regardless of your day-to-day involvement. Non-executive directors, for example, still have these duties.

### "We Engage Consultants—We're Covered"

Engaging consultants is part of meeting due diligence, but it does not eliminate the obligation. You must still verify that recommendations are implemented and effective.

### "We Haven't Had Any Incidents—We Must Be Compliant"

Luck is not a control measure. Absence of incidents does not prove compliance. Proactive verification is required.

### "It's Too Technical—I Can't Be Expected to Understand"

While you need not be a technical expert, you must have sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions. "I didn't understand" is not a defense.

## Demonstrating Due Diligence

How can you demonstrate that you are meeting your obligations? Documentation and actions both matter.

### Board or Leadership Level Actions

- Regular safety items on board agendas (not just when incidents occur)
- Safety reporting at every meeting
- Documented decisions on safety matters
- Budgets that reflect safety priorities
- Safety objectives in business planning
- Officer training in WHS matters

### Personal Actions

- Attendance at safety training
- Site visits and workplace observations
- Questions and challenges about safety matters in meetings
- Follow-up on safety issues raised
- Reading and understanding safety reports
- Involvement in incident reviews

### Organizational Evidence

- Implemented WHS management system
- Regular audits with documented follow-up
- Training records
- Incident investigation reports
- Risk assessments for high-risk activities
- Emergency response plans and testing
- Consultation mechanisms with workers
